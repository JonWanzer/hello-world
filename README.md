# hello-world
First repository and GitHub learning sandbox

Never been much of a code jocky, lots of scripting, HTML, and CSS, you know, text formatting and  little PHP and SQL thrown in for good measure. There was a time long ago (80s) I wrote a little BASICA but thats about it. I guess its time to learn Python and C/C++. I am starting to use Arduino and RBPi in RF electronics projects so it's time.
